# Deep Leaning
> This repository is an ensemble of different kinds of applications implemented using Tensorflow and Keras. A very good guide for beginners. The following table gives a overview(besides the name) of what different folder contains.

#### **_Table of contents_**:
| Folders        | Descriptions       |
| :-------------: |:-------------|
| CatsVsDogs|Binary classification between cats and dogs images from Kaggle dogs-vs-cats dataset, using RESNET architecture. The model inspired from Coursera course. |
| HandGestureDigitRecog| Classification of digits from images, where digits are shown by hand gesture, using LENET model.|
| Titanic - Kaggle | Binary classification task performed on Titanic dataset from Kaggle using (not so deep) Dense model using Keras. Good example for ultimate starters.|
|ObjectDetectionInImage_YOLOv3| Object detection task perform using YOLOv3 model on images. Code and model inspired by Coursera course.|
|ObjectDetectionInVideo_YOLOv3| Object detection task perform using YOLOv3 model on video frames. Code and model inspired by Coursera course.|
