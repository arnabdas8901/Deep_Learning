This Project Contains a python script and a Google colab ipynb file that  contain a model for handwritten digit recognition.
The model is build using Keras API. And the model is inspired by Lenet5, although small changes is done in the architecture.
The model is having 12 Layers and around 68,105 trainable param, with a minibatch size o 1000.

The notebook contain a complete summary of the model as well as the complete structure of the model is also included,

The model predicts output in float, although this can easily be changed to integer while predicting(Not included).

The data set is taken from the website http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
And an additional test image is taken from Coursera course exercise for predicting.
